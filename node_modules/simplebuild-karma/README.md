# Simplebuild-Karma

A simple library for automating Karma.

[Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) is a test runner for JavaScript. Itâ€™s useful for automated cross-browser testing. This library provides a simple interface to Karma that's convenient to use with task automation tools such as [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) or [Jake](https://github.com/mde/jake).


## Installation

This is a Node.js library. Install Node, then:

`npm install simplebuild-karma` (add `--save` or `--save-dev` if you want)

Note that this library uses your existing Karma installation. (Karma will be installed if needed.)


## Usage

This library provides these functions:

* `start`: Start the Karma server.
* `run`: Run Karma.

There are two main ways to use Karma: launch Karma and test browsers once and leave them running ("development" workflow), or start Karma and the browsers every time you test ("CI server" workflow).

To use the development workflow, call `start`, manually capture your test browsers, then call `run` every time you want to run your tests. (To make Karma capture your test browsers automatically, use the `browsers` option in the [Karma config file](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/config/browsers.html).)

To use the CI server workflow, call `run` with the `capture` option set. Karma will launch, capture your browsers, run your tests, then automatically shut down.


### `start(options, success, failure)`

Start the Karma server and leave it running.

* `options`: an object containing the following properties:
    * `configFile` (string): path to the Karma config file.

* `success()`: a function to call if the server exits successfully.

* `failure(message)`: a function to call if the server does not exit successfully. A simple error message is provided in the `message` parameter, but detailed error messages are provided by Karma to stdout (or stderr).


### `run(options, success, failure)`

Run Karma tests. You need to call `start` first unless you use the `capture` option. 

* `options`: an object containing the following properties:
    * `configFile` (string): path to the Karma config file.
    * `expectedBrowsers` (optional array of strings, default `[]`): a list of test browsers. A warning is printed to stdout for each browser in the list that isn't tested. The string must exactly match the string displayed by Karma (e.g., "Chrome 42.0.2311 (Mac OS X 10.10.3)").
    * `strict` (optional boolean, default `true`): causes the tests to fail if `expectedBrowsers` results in any warnings.
    * `capture` (optional array of strings, default `[]`): if present, automatically starts Karma, captures the provided browsers, and shuts them down when done. (Equivalent to using `karma start configFile --browsers XX,YY --single-run`.)
    * `clientArgs` (optional array of strings, default `[]`): options to pass through to your test adapter. For example, when using Mocha, providing `[ "--grep=SOMETHING" ]` will cause Mocha to only run tests containing the string "SOMETHING." The behavior of this parameter depends on your test adapter. It's equivalent to the `client.args` option in [the Karma configuration file](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/config/configuration-file.html).
    
* `success()`: a function to call if the tests succeed.

* `failure(message)`: a function to call if the tests fail. A simple error message is provided in the `message` parameter, but detailed error messages are provided by Karma to stdout (or stderr).


## Examples

This library is designed to be easy to integrate with any task automation tool:

### Grunt

```javascript
var karma = require("simplebuild-karma");

module.exports = function(grunt) {
    grunt.initConfig({
        karma: {
            configFile: "karma.conf.js",
            expectedBrowsers: [
                "Chrome 42.0.2311 (Mac OS X 10.10.3)",
                "Firefox 37.0.0 (Mac OS X 10.10)"
            ]
        }
    });

    grunt.registerTask("karma", "Start Karma server", function() {
        karma.start(grunt.config("karma"), this.async(), grunt.warn);
    });
    
    grunt.registerTask("test", "Run tests", function() {
        karma.run(grunt.config("karma"), this.async(), grunt.warn);
    });

    grunt.registerTask("default", [ "test" ]);
};
```

### Jake

```javascript
var karma = require("simplebuild-karma");

task("default", [ "test" ]);

desc("Start Karma server");
task("karma", function() {
    karma.start({
        configFile: "karma.conf.js"
    }, complete, fail);
}, { async: true });

desc("Run tests");
task("test", function() {
    karma.run({
        configFile: "karma.conf.js",
        expectedBrowsers: [
            "Chrome 42.0.2311 (Mac OS X 10.10.3)",
            "Firefox 37.0.0 (Mac OS X 10.10)"
        ]
    }, complete, fail);
}, { async: true });
```

### Plain JavaScript

```javascript
var karma = require("simplebuild-karma");

karma.run({
    configFile: "karma.conf.js",
    expectedBrowsers: [
        "Chrome 42.0.2311 (Mac OS X 10.10.3)",
        "Firefox 37.0.0 (Mac OS X 10.10)"
    ],
    capture: [ "Chrome", "Firefox" ]
}, function() {
    console.log("OK");
}, function(message) {
    console.log(message);
});
```
