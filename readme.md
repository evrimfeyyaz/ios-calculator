Prerequisites
-------------

1. Node.js 6.5.0.
1. npm.

Installation
------------

1. Run `./jake.sh` to build.
1. Run `./jake.sh run` to run a local server.
1. Use `./jake.sh -T` to see all available tasks.

But why?
--------
This is a small project I made for fun. I'm aware that it's not an exact clone of the iOS calculator, that there are so many small imperfections like the "plus-minus" sign looking kind of awkward, the lines in the operator signs not being exactly the same width, etc.
